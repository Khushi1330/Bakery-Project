**# 1. Backend Language: Python (Flask)**
**Q Why Flask?**

Flask is lightweight and fast for building REST APIs.

Flask has excellent extensions for PostgreSQL (psycopg2), Redis (redis-py), and RabbitMQ (pika).

It allowed quick development with clean structure and easy maintenance.

**# 2. Database: PostgreSQL**
**Why PostgreSQL?**

PostgreSQL is reliable, open-source, and supports complex queries.

Ideal for structured bakery data like products, orders, and inventory management.

Easy to run inside Docker and manage persistence via volumes.

**# 3. Frontend Framework: React.js**
**Why React?**

React allows building dynamic, single-page applications.

Reactâ€™s component-based architecture makes the UI modular and maintainable.

Easy to fetch and render product data from the backend API.

**# 4. Message Queue: RabbitMQ**

**Why RabbitMQ?**

RabbitMQ enables asynchronous communication between backend and worker services.

It decouples order creation from order processing, improving system responsiveness.

Message durability ensures orders are not lost even if services restart.

**# 5. Caching Layer: Redis**

**Why Redis?**

Redis provides in-memory caching to accelerate the GET /api/products endpoint.

Reduces database load by serving frequent requests from cache.

TTL (Time-To-Live) feature automatically expires cache entries, keeping data fresh.

**# 6. Worker Service**

**Why a Worker Service?** 

Separating order processing from the backend avoids blocking API responses.

The worker pulls messages from RabbitMQ and processes them independently.

Improves scalability and system resilience.

** # 7. Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose**
**Why Containerize?**

Containers ensure consistent environments across development and production.

Easy orchestration and scaling using Docker Compose.

Services are isolated, networked securely, and can be restarted independently.

**8. Health Checks**

**Why Health Checks?**

Health checks ensure that containers are running properly.

Docker Compose can detect and restart unhealthy services automatically.

**# 9. Environment Variables**

**Why Use .env?**

Environment variables separate sensitive information from source code.

Easy to manage different setups (development, production) without changing the codebase.

**# 10. Volumes for Persistence**
**Why Volumes?**

Database and RabbitMQ volumes persist critical data even when containers are destroyed.

Ensures important bakery system information (products, orders) is not lost on restarts.

ðŸŒŸ Conclusion

The Bakery System architecture follows modern best practices:

Decoupled services (API, Queue, Worker)

Fast response time (caching)

High availability (persistent volumes + health checks)

Scalable (via container orchestration)

Each design decision was made with performance, maintainability, and scalability in mind.
